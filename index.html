<h1>All About Diabolos</h1>
<hr>
  <p>A diabolo is a skill toy that is basically a big yoyo without a string. Instead, the string is attached to two sticks and you use the sticks to control the diabolo. A diabolo has the same physics as a gyroscope. When it's spinning it will be able to balance in preety much anything as long as you stay on the bearing. In one trick, Hand Held, (which I created by the way) you take the diabolo off the string and hold it in your hand then place it back on the string.</p>
